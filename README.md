# 🌍 Travel Journal
Travel Journal is the main project developed during the **Data-Driven React** module, which is part of the _React Basics_ curriculum on the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/). This app showcases a list of travel destinations using reusable React components.

All the data displayed on the page is stored in a regular JavaScript file in the form of objects and arrays. The React code imports this data, maps over it, and renders components dynamically with the relevant information.

The project is based on a [Figma design]((https://www.figma.com/design/QG4cOExkdbIbhSfWJhs2gs/Travel-Journal?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=S7q00yeATzFBQMl4-0)) provided in the course.
