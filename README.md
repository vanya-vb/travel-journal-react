# 🌍 Travel Journal
Travel Journal is the main project developed during the **Data-Driven React** module, which is part of the _React Basics_ curriculum on the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/). This app showcases a list of travel destinations using reusable React components.

All the data displayed on the page is stored in a regular JavaScript file in the form of objects and arrays. The React code imports this data, maps over it, and renders components dynamically with the relevant information.
